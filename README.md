# 📱 Art Showcase

Art Showcase is an iOS app developed during a course at [BackFront Academy](https://backfront.academy) using **Swift** — primarily with **UIKit** and **ViewCode**.  
It follows the **MVVM architectural pattern** and best development practices.  

The goal of this project is to build a fully functional application that demonstrates key Swift concepts such as **UITableView**, **UICollectionView**, API integration with **Alamofire**, and more — all aimed at learning how to create a real-world iOS app.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 Displays a curated list of art pieces using **UITableView**
- 🖼️ Shows artwork details with custom layouts via **UICollectionView**
- 🌐 Fetches data from a public API using **Alamofire**
- 📱 Built entirely with **UIKit** and **ViewCode** (no Storyboards)
- 🧠 Applies the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern
- 📦 Organized and modular code structure for scalability and readability

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Swift** — Main programming language
- **UIKit** — UI framework for building the app interface
- **ViewCode** — UI created entirely in code (no Storyboards)
- **MVVM** — Architectural pattern to separate concerns
- **Alamofire** — For handling HTTP networking and API consumption
- **Xcode** — Official IDE used for development

---

### 💡 What I Learned

This project helped me understand how to work with the MVVM pattern, how to use Alamofire to consume APIs, and how to handle asynchronous data with UIKit.

One challenge was setting up the collection view layout correctly and managing dynamic image loading — it taught me a lot about organizing views efficiently.

## ℹ️ Observações

> ⚠️ **Atenção:** este projeto utiliza um **Mock interno para simular dados da API**.  
> Dependendo da versão do código ou de atualizações no Xcode, pode ser necessário **ajustar ou recriar os dados de mock** para que o app funcione corretamente.  
> Caso encontre erros ao rodar o projeto, verifique os arquivos relacionados ao mock e certifique-se de que estão configurados corretamente.
