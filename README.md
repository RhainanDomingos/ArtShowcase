# 📱 Art Showcase

The app Art Showcase was created during a course at BackFront Academy using Swift, primarily with UIKit and ViewCode.
It was built following the MVVM architecture and development practices.
The goal of this project is to create a fully usable and functional app to practice Swift features such as UITableView,
UICollectionView, API consumption, integration with the Alamofire framework, and other technologies — all with the 
purpose of learning how to make a real-world app.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 Displays a curated list of art pieces using **UITableView**
- 🖼️ Shows artwork details with custom layouts via **UICollectionView**
- 🌐 Fetches data from a public API using **Alamofire**
- 📱 Built entirely with **UIKit** and **ViewCode** (no Storyboards)
- 🧠 Applies the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern
- 📦 Organized and modular code structure for scalability and readability


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Swift** — Main programming language
- **UIKit** — UI framework for building the app interface
- **ViewCode** — UI created fully in code (no Storyboards)
- **MVVM** — Architectural pattern to separate concerns
- **Alamofire** — For handling HTTP networking and API consumption
- **Xcode** — Official IDE used for development
