# 📱 Art Showcase

Art Showcase is an iOS app developed during a course at [BackFront Academy](https://backfront.academy) using **Swift** — primarily with **UIKit** and **ViewCode**.  
It follows the **MVVM architectural pattern** and best development practices.  

The goal of this project is to build a fully functional application that demonstrates key Swift concepts such as **UITableView**, **UICollectionView**, API integration with **Alamofire**, and more — all aimed at learning how to create a real-world iOS app.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 Displays a curated list of art pieces using **UITableView**
- 🖼️ Shows artwork details with custom layouts via **UICollectionView**
- 🌐 Fetches data from a public API using **Alamofire**
- 📱 Built entirely with **UIKit** and **ViewCode** (no Storyboards)
- 🧠 Applies the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern
- 📦 Organized and modular code structure for scalability and readability

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Swift** — Main programming language
- **UIKit** — UI framework for building the app interface
- **ViewCode** — UI created entirely in code (no Storyboards)
- **MVVM** — Architectural pattern to separate concerns
